```GP-Zoo``` is a collection of implementations of significant papers on Gaussian Processes with readable, simple code, over the past decade; ranging from Sparse Gaussian Process Regression from Titsias, 2009, to Stochastic Variational Gaussian Processes for classification and regression, by Hensman, 2014. 

## Contributing

GP-Zoo is a work-in-progress, so feel free to put in a PR and share in the work!

Notably, if you can find a way to add backtesting strategies through boolean expressions passed to the function, that would be really helpful!
